# Machine-Learning-Based-Vector-Detection-in-5G-Networks.
This project focuses on coding for the Gaussian Channel in the Finite Blocklength Regime (FBR) using a Convolutional Neural Network Autoencoder (CNN-AE). The aim is to address the challenges posed by ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) in wireless networks, particularly in 5G and beyond. The paper explores the potential of CNN-AEs to approach the theoretical maximum achievable rate over a Gaussian channel for various signal-to-noise ratios at a fixed blocklength and target frame error probability (FEP).

Unlike existing works that primarily explore CNNs from bit-error and symbol-error rate perspectives, this project takes a different approach by investigating CNN-AE architecture. The study includes the numerical evaluation of the proposed CNN-AE, comparing it to the theoretical maximum achievable rate, as well as benchmark schemes like polar coded quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), Reed-Muller coded QAM, multilevel polar coded modulation, and a TurboAE-MOD scheme from the literature.

The results indicate that the CNN-AE outperforms benchmark schemes and approaches the theoretical maximum rate, showcasing its capability in learning effective codes for delay-constrained applications. The project offers insights into the potential of neural networks, specifically CNN-AEs, for coding and modulation in the Finite Blocklength Regime, contributing to advancements in wireless communication systems.
